                <h3>body</h3>
                <p>A body is the physical material of a person or organism. It is only used for organisms which are in
                    one part or whole. There are organisms which change from single cells to whole organisms: for
                    example, slime moulds. For them the term 'body' would mean the multicellular stage. Other uses:</p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plant body</li>
                    <li>Cell body: here it may be used for cells like neurons which have long axons (nerve fibres). The
                        cell body is the part with the nucleus in it</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>The body of a dead person is also called a corpse or cadaver. The dead bodies of vertebrate animals
                    and insects are sometimes called carcasses</p>
                <p>The human body has a head, neck, torso, two arms, two legs and the genitals of the groin, which
                    differ between males and females</p>
                <p>The study of the body is anatomy.
                    The study of the workings of the body is physiology.
                    Here are the names of the body parts of a woman and a man.

                    The word body is sometimes used in other ways. For example, a lake is a body of water. The laws on a
                    topic are a "body of law".

                <h3>brain</h3>
                <p>The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, and with the spinal cord makes up
                    the central nervous system. The brain consists of the cerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum. It
                    controls most of the activities of the body, processing, integrating, and coordinating the
                    information it receives from the sense organs, and making decisions as to the instructions sent to
                    the rest of the body. The brain is contained in, and protected by, the skull bones of the head.</p>
                <p>The cerebrum, the largest part of the human brain, consists of two cerebral hemispheres. Each
                    hemisphere has an inner core composed of white matter, and an outer surface – the cerebral cortex –
                    composed of grey matter. The cortex has an outer layer, the neocortex, and an inner allocortex. The
                    neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers, while the allocortex has three or four. Each hemisphere
                    is conventionally divided into four lobes – the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes.
                    The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control, planning, reasoning,
                    and abstract thought, while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision. Within each lobe, cortical
                    areas are associated with specific functions, such as the sensory, motor and association regions.
                    Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function, some functions
                    are associated with one side, such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right.
                    The hemispheres are connected by commissural nerve tracts, the largest being the corpus callosum</p>
                <p>The cerebrum is connected by the brainstem to the spinal cord. The brainstem consists of the
                    midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The cerebellum is connected to the brainstem by three
                    pairs of nerve tracts called cerebellar peduncles. Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system,
                    consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and
                    circulated. Underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures, including the thalamus,
                    the epithalamus, the pineal gland, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the subthalamus; the
                    limbic structures, including the amygdalae and the hippocampi, the claustrum, the various nuclei of
                    the basal ganglia, the basal forebrain structures, and the three circumventricular organs. Brain
                    structures that are not on the midplane exist in pairs, so there are for example two hippocampi and
                    two amygdalae. The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells. There are more
                    than 86 billion neurons in the brain, and a more or less equal number of other cells. Brain activity
                    is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in
                    response to nerve impulses. Neurons connect to form neural pathways, neural circuits, and elaborate
                    network systems. The whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission</p>
                <p>The brain is protected by the skull, suspended in cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the
                    bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier. However, the brain is still susceptible to damage, disease,
                    and infection. Damage can be caused by trauma, or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke. The
                    brain is susceptible to degenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, dementias including
                    Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia and
                    clinical depression, are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions. The brain can also be the
                    site of tumours, both benign and malignant; these mostly originate from other sites in the body</p>
                <p>The study of the anatomy of the brain is neuroanatomy, while the study of its function is
                    neuroscience. Numerous techniques are used to study the brain. Specimens from other animals, which
                    may be examined microscopically, have traditionally provided much information. Medical imaging
                    technologies such as functional neuroimaging, and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are
                    important in studying the brain. The medical history of people with brain injury has provided
                    insight into the function of each part of the brain. Neuroscience research has expanded
                    considerably, and research is ongoing.</p>
                <p>In culture, the philosophy of mind has for centuries attempted to address the question of the nature
                    of consciousness and the mind–body problem. The pseudoscience of phrenology attempted to localise
                    personality attributes to regions of the cortex in the 19th century. In science fiction, brain
                    transplants are imagined in tales such as the 1942 Donovan's Brain.</p>
                <p>The adult human brain weighs on average about 1.2–1.4 kg (2.6–3.1 lb) which is about 2% of the total
                    body weight,[2][3] with a volume of around 1260 cm3 in men and 1130 cm3 in women.[4] There is
                    substantial individual variation,[4] with the standard reference range for men being 1,180–1,620 g
                    (2.60–3.57 lb)[5] and for women 1,030–1,400 g (2.27–3.09 lb).[6]</p>

                <h3>Lungs</h3>
                <p>The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and most other animals,
                    including some snails and a small number of fish. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs
                    are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system
                    is to extract oxygen from the air and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon
                    dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. The pleurae, which
                    are thin, smooth, and moist, serve to reduce friction between the lungs and chest wall during
                    breathing, allowing for easy and effortless movements of the lungs.</p>
                <p>Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds
                    use their different muscles to support and foster breathing. In earlier tetrapods, air was driven
                    into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians.
                    In humans, the main muscle of respiration that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also
                    provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible</p>
                <p>Humans have two lungs, one on the left and one on the right. They are situated within the thoracic
                    cavity of the chest. The right lung is bigger and heavier than the left, which shares space in the
                    chest with the heart. The lungs together weigh approximately 1.3 kilograms (2.9 pounds). The lungs
                    are part of the lower respiratory tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and
                    bronchioles, and which receive air breathed in via the conducting zone. The conducting zone ends at
                    the terminal bronchioles. These divide into the respiratory bronchioles of the respiratory zone
                    which divide into alveolar ducts that give rise to the alveolar sacs that contain the alveoli, where
                    gas exchange takes place. Alveoli are also sparsely present on the walls of the respiratory
                    bronchioles and alveolar ducts. Together, the lungs contain approximately 2,400 kilometres (1,500
                    miles) of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli. Each lung is enclosed within a pleural sac of two
                    membranes called pleurae; the membranes are separated by a film of pleural fluid, which allows the
                    inner and outer membranes to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place, without much
                    friction. The inner pleura also divides each lung into sections called lobes. The right lung has
                    three lobes and the left has two. The lobes are further divided into bronchopulmonary segments and
                    pulmonary lobules. The lungs have a unique blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood from the heart
                    in the pulmonary circulation for the purposes of receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and
                    a separate supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the bronchial circulation.</p>
                <p>The tissue of the lungs can be affected by a number of respiratory diseases, including pneumonia and
                    lung cancer. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and
                    can be related to smoking or exposure to harmful substances. A number of occupational lung diseases
                    can be caused by substances such as coal dust, asbestos fibres, and crystalline silica dust.
                    Diseases such as bronchitis can also affect the respiratory tract. Medical terms related to the lung
                    often begin with pulmo-, from the Latin pulmonarius (of the lungs) as in pulmonology, or with
                    pneumo- (from Greek πνεύμων "lung") as in pneumonia</p>
                <p>In embryonic development, the lungs begin to develop as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which
                    goes on to form the upper part of the digestive system. When the lungs are formed the fetus is held
                    in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from
                    the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. At birth, however, air begins to pass through the lungs,
                    and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully
                    develop in early childhood</p>

            <div id="box" class="heart">
                <h3>heart</h3>
                <p>The heart is a muscular organ in most animals. This organ pumps blood through the blood vessels of
                    the circulatory system.[1] The pumped blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the body, while carrying
                    metabolic waste such as carbon dioxide to the lungs. In humans, the heart is approximately the size
                    of a closed fist and is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest, called
                    the mediastinum</p>
                <p>In humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right
                    atria and lower left and right ventricles. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred
                    together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. Fish, in contrast, have
                    two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while most reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart
                    blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow.The heart is
                    enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. The wall
                    of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium</p>
                <p>The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node.
                    These generate a current that causes the heart to contract, traveling through the atrioventricular
                    node and along the conduction system of the heart. In humans, deoxygenated blood enters the heart
                    through the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right
                    ventricle. From here it is pumped into pulmonary circulation to the lungs, where it receives oxygen
                    and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the
                    left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta into systemic circulation, traveling through
                    arteries, arterioles, and capillaries—where nutrients and other substances are exchanged between
                    blood vessels and cells, losing oxygen and gaining carbon dioxide—before being returned to the heart
                    through venules and veins. The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute.Exercise
                    temporarily increases the rate, but lowers it in the long term, and is good for heart health..
                </p>
                <p>Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of
                    deaths.[11][12] Of these more than three-quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and
                    stroke.Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high
                    blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others.Cardiovascular diseases do not
                    frequently have symptoms but may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease
                    is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope,
                    as well as with ECG, echocardiogram, and ultrasound.Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart
                    are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.</p>

            <div id="box" class="kidney">
                <h3>Kidney</h3>
                <p>In humans, the kidneys are two reddish-brown bean-shaped blood-filtering organs[1] that are a
                    multilobar multipapillary form of mammalian kidney, usually without signs of external
                    lobulation.They are located on the left and right in the retroperitoneal space, and in adult humans
                    are about 12 centimetres (4+1⁄2 inches) in length. They receive blood from the paired renal
                    arteries; blood exits into the paired renal veins. Each kidney is attached to a ureter, a tube that
                    carries excreted urine to the bladder</p>
                <p>The kidney participates in the control of the volume of various body fluids, fluid osmolality,
                    acid–base balance, various electrolyte concentrations, and removal of toxins. Filtration occurs in
                    the glomerulus: one-fifth of the blood volume that enters the kidneys is filtered. Examples of
                    substances reabsorbed are solute-free water, sodium, bicarbonate, glucose, and amino acids. Examples
                    of substances secreted are hydrogen, ammonium, potassium and uric acid. The nephron is the
                    structural and functional unit of the kidney. Each adult human kidney contains around 1 million
                    nephrons, while a mouse kidney contains only about 12,500 nephrons. The kidneys also carry out
                    functions independent of the nephrons. For example, they convert a precursor of vitamin D to its
                    active form, calcitriol; and synthesize the hormones erythropoietin and renin</p>
                <p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been recognized as a leading public health problem worldwide. The
                    global estimated prevalence of CKD is 13.4%, and patients with kidney failure needing renal
                    replacement therapy are estimated between 5 and 7 million.[6] Procedures used in the management of
                    kidney disease include chemical and microscopic examination of the urine (urinalysis), measurement
                    of kidney function by calculating the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the serum
                    creatinine; and kidney biopsy and CT scan to evaluate for abnormal anatomy. Dialysis and kidney
                    transplantation are used to treat kidney failure; one (or both sequentially) of these are almost
                    always used when renal function drops below 15%. Nephrectomy is frequently used to cure renal cell
                    carcinoma.</p>
                <p>Renal physiology is the study of kidney function. Nephrology is the medical specialty which addresses
                    diseases of kidney function: these include CKD, nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, acute kidney
                    injury, and pyelonephritis. Urology addresses diseases of kidney (and urinary tract) anatomy: these
                    include cancer, renal cysts, kidney stones and ureteral stones, and urinary tract obstruction</p>
                <p>The word “renal” is an adjective meaning “relating to the kidneys”, and its roots are French or late
                    Latin. Whereas according to some opinions, "renal" should be replaced with "kidney" in scientific
                    writings such as "kidney artery", other experts have advocated preserving the use of "renal" as
                    appropriate including in "renal artery"</p>

                <p>The liver is a major metabolic organ only found in vertebrate animals, which performs many essential
                    biological functions such as detoxification of the organism, and the synthesis of proteins and
                    biochemicals necessary for digestion and growth.In humans, it is located in the right upper quadrant
                    of the abdomen, below the diaphragm and mostly shielded by the lower right rib cage. Its other
                    metabolic roles include carbohydrate metabolism, the production of hormones, conversion and storage
                    of nutrients such as glucose and glycogen, and the decomposition of red blood cells</p>
                <p>The liver is also an accessory digestive organ that produces bile, an alkaline fluid containing
                    cholesterol and bile acids, which emulsifies and aids the breakdown of dietary fat. The gallbladder,
                    a small hollow pouch that sits just under the right lobe of liver, stores and concentrates the bile
                    produced by the liver, which is later excreted to the duodenum to help with digestion.The liver's
                    highly specialized tissue, consisting mostly of hepatocytes, regulates a wide variety of high-volume
                    biochemical reactions, including the synthesis and breakdown of small and complex organic molecules,
                    many of which are necessary for normal vital functions. Estimates regarding the organ's total number
                    of functions vary, but is generally cited as being around 500.</p>
                <p>It is not known how to compensate for the absence of liver function in the long term, although liver
                    dialysis techniques can be used in the short term. Artificial livers have not been developed to
                    promote long-term replacement in the absence of the liver. As of 2018, liver transplantation is the
                    only option for complete liver failure.</p>

                <h3>stomach</h3>
                <p>The stomach is a muscular, hollow organ in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and many other
                    animals, including several invertebrates. The stomach has a dilated structure and functions as a
                    vital organ in the digestive system. The stomach is involved in the gastric phase of digestion,
                    following chewing. It performs a chemical breakdown by means of enzymes and hydrochloric acid.</p>
                <p>In humans and many other animals, the stomach is located between the esophagus and the small
                    intestine. The stomach secretes digestive enzymes and gastric acid to aid in food digestion. The
                    pyloric sphincter controls the passage of partially digested food (chyme) from the stomach into the
                    duodenum, where peristalsis takes over to move this through the rest of the intestines.</p>

                <h3>Intestine</h3>
                <p>The small intestine or small bowel is an organ in the gastrointestinal tract where most of the
                    absorption of nutrients from food takes place. It lies between the stomach and large intestine, and
                    receives bile and pancreatic juice through the pancreatic duct to aid in digestion. The small
                    intestine is about 5.5 metres (18 feet) long and folds many times to fit in the abdomen. Although it
                    is longer than the large intestine, it is called the small intestine because it is narrower in
                    diameter.</p>
                <p>The small intestine has three distinct regions – the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The duodenum, the
                    shortest, is where preparation for absorption through small finger-like protrusions called villi
                    begins.[2] The jejunum is specialized for the absorption through its lining by enterocytes: small
                    nutrient particles which have been previously digested by enzymes in the duodenum. The main function
                    of the ileum is to absorb vitamin B12, bile salts, and whatever products of digestion that were not
                    absorbed by the jejunum</p>
                <p>The length of the small intestine can vary greatly, from as short as 3 metres (10 feet) to as long as
                    10.5 m (34+1⁄2 ft), also depending on the measuring technique used.The typical length in a living
                    person is 3–5 m (10–16+1⁄2 ft).The length depends both on how tall the person is and how the length
                    is measured.Taller people generally have a longer small intestine and measurements are generally
                    longer after death and when the bowel is empty.

                    It is approximately 1.5 centimetres (5⁄8 inch) in diameter in newborns after 35 weeks of gestational
                    age, and 2.5–3 cm (1–1+1⁄8 in) in diameter in adults. On abdominal X-rays, the small intestine is
                    considered to be abnormally dilated when the diameter exceeds 3 cm.[8][9] On CT scans, a diameter of
                    over 2.5 cm is considered abnormally dilated.[8][10] The surface area of the human small intestinal
                    mucosa, due to enlargement caused by folds, villi and microvilli, averages 30 square metres (320 sq
                    ft).

                <h3>Male_Reproductive</h3>
                <p>The male reproductive system consists of a number of sex organs that play a role in the process of
                    human reproduction. These organs are located on the outside of the body and within the pelvis.</p>
                <p>The main male sex organs are the penis and the testicles which produce semen and sperm, which, as
                    part of sexual intercourse, fertilize an ovum in the female's body; the fertilized ovum (zygote)
                    develops into a fetus, which is later born as an infant.</p>
                <p>The corresponding system in females is the female reproductive system</p>

                <h3>Female-Reproductive</h3>
                <p>The female reproductive system is made up of the internal and external sex organs that function in
                    the reproduction of new offspring. In humans, the female reproductive system is immature at birth
                    and develops to maturity at puberty to be able to produce gametes, and to carry a fetus to full
                    term. The internal sex organs are the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The female
                    reproductive tract includes the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes and is prone to infections.[1]
                    The vagina allows for sexual intercourse and childbirth, and is connected to the uterus at the
                    cervix. The uterus or womb accommodates the embryo which develops into the fetus. The uterus also
                    produces secretions which help the transit of sperm to the fallopian tubes, where sperm fertilize
                    ova (egg cells) produced by the ovaries. The external sex organs are also known as the genitals and
                    these are the organs of the vulva including the labia, clitoris, and vaginal opening</p>
                <p>During the menstrual cycle, the ovaries release an ovum, which transits through the fallopian tube
                    into the uterus. If an egg cell meets with sperm on its way to the uterus, a single sperm cell can
                    enter and merge with it, fertilizing it into a zygote</p>
                <p>Fertilization usually occurs in the fallopian tubes and marks the beginning of embryogenesis. The
                    zygote will then divide over enough generations of cells to form a blastocyst, which implants itself
                    in the wall of the uterus. This begins the period of gestation and the embryo will continue to
                    develop until full-term. When the fetus has developed enough to survive outside the uterus, the
                    cervix dilates and contractions of the uterus propel the newborn through the birth canal (the
                    vagina)</p>
                <p>The corresponding equivalent among males is the male reproductive system.</p>
